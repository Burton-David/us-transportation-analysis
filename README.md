# Means of Transportation to Work Analysis

An analysis of commuting patterns in the United States using the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates dataset.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes transportation modes based on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics dataset, exploring how workers across the United States travel to their workplaces. The analysis covers various transportation modes including:

- Private vehicles (driving alone vs. carpooling)
- Public transportation
- Biking and walking
- Remote work arrangements

## Dataset

The dataset combines commuting data from the 2023 ACS 5-year estimates with Census tract-level geographic boundaries, providing insights into transportation patterns across different regions.

## Analysis Highlights

The analysis explores:
1. National-level transportation mode distribution
2. State-by-state comparisons of transportation patterns
3. Urban vs. rural transportation differences
4. Public transportation usage variations
5. Alternative transportation mode adoption
6. Geographic impacts on transportation choices

## Getting Started
